# Creating a Machine Learning Project with Cookiecutter and GitHub

Welcome! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to jump-start your machine learning projects using [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/). We'll generate a clean, standardized project structure and then connect it with GitHub for version control and collaboration.

At the end of this tutorial, you now have a well-organized machine learning project structure generated by `Cookiecutter`, managed with `Git`, and hosted on `GitHub`.

## Introduction

When starting a machine learning project, a well-organized structure can save you hours of setup and maintenance. [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) is a command-line utility that creates projects from templates—ensuring you follow best practices right from the start.

In this guide, we will use the popular [cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) template. This template provides a robust folder structure that is easy to understand and modify as your project grows.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python (3.6 or later)**
- **Git**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Vscode**: Any IDE such as PyCharm, Spyder, etc.    

If you haven't installed these, please follow the installation guides on their respective websites.

---

## Step 1: Installing Cookiecutter

First, install Cookiecutter using pip. Open your IDE/ or terminal and run:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

This command will download and install Cookiecutter, allowing you to generate new projects from any Cookiecutter template.

## Step 2: Creating Your ML Project Structure

Now that Cookiecutter is installed, let's use it to create your machine learning project. We'll use the cookiecutter-data-science template:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
```
**What to Expect**

Interactive Prompts: The command will prompt you for some project-specific details (e.g., project_name, repo_name, author_name). Fill these in as you see fit. For example:

```plaintext
project_name [My Awesome Project]: MyMLProject
repo_name [my_ml_project]:
author_name [Your Name]: Jane Doe
description [A short description of the project.]: A cool ML project using Cookiecutter!
```

**Project Creation**: Once you answer the prompts, Cookiecutter will generate a directory structure for your project

## Step 3: Exploring the Project Structure

Navigate into your newly created project directory:

```bash
cd MyMLProject
```
Take a look at the folder structure. A typical structure might include:

```kotlin
MyMLProject/
├── data/
│   ├── external/
│   ├── interim/
│   ├── processed/
│   └── raw/
├── docs/
├── models/
├── notebooks/
├── references/
├── reports/
│   └── figures/
└── src/
    ├── data/
    ├── features/
    ├── models/
    └── visualization/
```
**Understanding the Structure**

- data/: Where your datasets live. Subfolders help segregate raw, interim, and processed data.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.

- src/: Contains your source code divided into data processing, feature engineering, modeling, etc.

- reports/: For storing generated reports and visualizations.

This organization helps keep your work tidy and reproducible.


## Step 4: Initializing Git and Connecting to GitHub

With your project in place, it's time to start version controlling your work with Git and set up a remote repository on GitHub.

**Initialize Git**

Inside your project directory, initialize a Git repository:
```bash
git init
```

Add all your files and make your first commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Created project structure with Cookiecutter"
```
**Create a Repository on GitHub**
1. Log in to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Click on New (or use [this link](https://github.com/new)) to create a new repository.
   - Name it the same as your local project (e.g., MyMLProject).
2. Do not initialize with a README (since you already have one or can add it later).

## Step 5: Pushing Your Project to GitHub

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository and push your changes.

**Add the Remote Repository**
Replace <your-github-username> and <repository-name> with your details:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<repository-name>.git
```

**Push Your Code**
Push your initial commit to GitHub:

```bash
git branch -M main  # Ensure your main branch is named 'main'
git push -u origin main
```
After running these commands, refresh your GitHub repository page, and you should see your project files online!

**Conclusion**
Congratulations! You now have a well-organized machine learning project structure generated by `Cookiecutter`, managed with `Git`, and hosted on `GitHub`. This setup will make it easier for you (and others) to understand, collaborate on, and maintain your project over time.

Happy coding and machine learning!
