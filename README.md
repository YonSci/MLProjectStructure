## Introduction

When starting a machine learning project, a well-organized structure can save you hours of setup and maintenance. [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) is a command-line utility that creates projects from templatesâ€”ensuring you follow best practices right from the start.

In this guide, we will use the popular [cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) template. This template provides a robust folder structure that is easy to understand and modify as your project grows.
